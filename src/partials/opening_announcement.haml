  %p We are quite excited and happy to announce the official date and place for JSConf 2009. After weeks of hard work, we have been able to secure the luxurious and convenient <a href="http://www.hotelpalomar-arlington.com/">Hotel Palomar Arlington</a> in Rosslyn, Virginia for Friday April 24 and Saturday April 25 of 2009. We have posted all the details about special room rates, locations, and local airports on the <a href="/accommodations.html">accommodations page</a>. The hotel is a prime location that will allow both local and long distance guests to easily navigate Washington DC without a car. We are still finalizing speakers and pricing, but the dates and place for the conference are now locked. The rest of the information should be available in the coming weeks. We are quite excited about the conference and hope that you will join us in putting JavaScript in the limelight it rightfully deserves.
