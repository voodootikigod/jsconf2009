      Apache CouchDB can serve applications written using familiar Ajax patterns, using no middle-tier application server. Standalone CouchApps are quick and easy to develop, as well as being easily portable. They are ideal for in-house or education projects, as well as opening up novel opportunities using CouchDB's peer-based replication. In this talk I'll walk you through hello world with CouchApps, and then explain some of the new possibilities they open up.

      Introduction to SproutCore: This exciting new JavaScript framework allows developers to build fluid and feature-rich desktop clients that run inside the web-browser, such as Apple's MobileMe suite.  It uses the full power of JavaScript but takes its inspiration from the Cocoa framework, specifically the use of Key-Value Observation.  The talk will include short videos and live coding and will not be your typical "talk to my slides" presentation.

      This session will provide a high level overview of the Objective-J language and Cappuccino frameworks.  We'll spend a short period of time discussing both these technologies and the reasoning behind them.  Then we'll dive right into showing you how to use them to create beautiful and immersive user interfaces for your web applications that parallel those found on the desktop.  We'll cover how to add features such as drag and drop, copy/paste, undo/redo, and autosave.
