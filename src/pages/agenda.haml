  %p JSConf 2009 will be a one track conference of some of the greatest thought leaders in the JavaScript community. The speakers and topics are presented in detail on the <a href="/speakers.html">Speakers</a> section. The current agenda for JSConf 2009 is presented below, speakers will be assigned to slots in the coming weeks as well as more details about the special social events. During all 20 minute breaks, there will be refreshments provided. Please check back often or follow our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jsconf">Twitter feed</a> for updates as the schedule will not be finalized until March 15, 2009. <strong>One item of note</strong>,  if you want to present at JSConf 2009 on a topic, product, or idea that you have, there will be a side room for lightning talks and hackfests. The conference will blend the best parts of a normal lecture style conference and a "-camp" style conference. We will be posting to Twitter as soon as new speakers, special events, and final agenda items are made public.

  %h4#food Conference Food Unlike Any Other
  %p Before you get too deep into the agenda, we just want you to know that we originally selected Hotel Palomar for the conference venue because of it amazingly sophisticated look and feel. One of the key factors is that its food selection is not like other hotel venues. This conference will have some of the best meals you have had at a conference - and that was before. <a href="/sponsors.html#mozilla">Mozilla</a> has nicely sponsored JSConf in order to ensure you have the <strong>best breakfast, lunch, and snack breaks</strong> at a conference. Come hungry for knowledge and food - we got you covered on both accounts!
