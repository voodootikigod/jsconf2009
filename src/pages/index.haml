%p JSConf 2009 is a conference devoted to the programming language we all love to hate and hate to love, <span>JavaScript</span>. This is not trying to be like every other lecture style conference, but a ground-up rewrite on the conference style. It will be thoughtful, content driven, and exemplify the very nature of JavaScript, at its core we encourage debate and discussion over general information conveyance. No matter which programming language you love, you know of the <span class="ppsub">pleasure</span> of JavaScript programming. 
%p Come to this conference if you love JavaScript, come if you hate it, come if you don't even know how to program. Whatever drives you to come, you can be sure of one thing, there will be a lot of <span class="hbsub">happiness</span> to go around. After all, we are talking about <span>JavaScript</span> here.
%p We are trying to build the conference in such a manner that it addresses the core issues of the community instead of glazing over them and announces the cutting edge technologies in a language that often gets overlooked. The content and conference style will be different from most other conferences, not barcamp-style and not multi-track style, but somewhere between the two.
%p We are trying to make something different and we are trying to do it with JavaScript.
