                Apache CouchDB can serve applications written using familiar Ajax patterns, using no middle-tier application server. Standalone CouchApps are quick and easy to develop, as well as being easily portable. They are ideal for in-house or education projects, as well as opening up novel opportunities using CouchDB's peer-based replication. In this talk I'll walk you through hello world with CouchApps, and then explain some of the new possibilities they open up.

                A new real time Web is emerging, backed by the eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  This protocol is designed for low latency, real time communication, publish-subscribe, and social networking. You will learn how XMPP and HTTP can be combined to make new applications possible and how to harness XMPP from JavaScript.  We will use the Strophe library to create a few simple XMPP applications.

                This session will provide a high level overview of the Objective-J language and Cappuccino frameworks.  We'll spend a short period of time discussing both these technologies and the reasoning behind them.  Then we'll dive right into showing you how to use them to create beautiful and immersive user interfaces for your web applications that parallel those found on the desktop.  We'll cover how to add features such as drag and drop, copy/paste, undo/redo, and autosave.
