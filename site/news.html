                  <p>Using <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> to create "edgy" web applications that are stored in the database. <a href="http://github.com/jchris/couchapp/tree/master">CouchApps</a> allows you to store not only data in a database like CouchDB, but also full applications, which lends to some rather interesting use cases. Not only do applications then scale up and out, but their ability to revision control themselves comes for free. The CouchApps are pure JavaScript applications that sit on top of the power of CouchDB, and then allow the applications and data to become instantly portable and shareable through replication. This tag team presentation will give you some powerful insight into the concepts of CouchDB and CouchApps.</p>

The focus concept is the "Real Time Web" and how to actually accomplish low latency rich data applications that put AJAX to shame. With Strophe you can leverage all the goodness of XMPP at the client side.

                  <p>If you saw <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23jsconf">#jsconf</a> on the Trending Topics, this presentation had a major hand in it. As Brian mentions, he re-did his slides after a late night empanada, so you can only imagine how crazy it gets -- and it exceeds your wildest expectations. Brian's topic is focused around using JavaScript on the mobile platforms, specifically the breakout <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> framework to kick some major handheld ass using JavaScript. Without out further gabbing, you really need to click the play button and enjoy (and pass on to a friend).</p>

                    Whether you were able to join us at JSConf 2009 or helped spread the excitement of the event, Laura and I would like to extend our deepest appreciation. The JavaScript community is absolutely amazing and we need to keep the excitement going. We will be unveiling the videos for free on this site as soon as we can get them out of post-production (OK maybe a couple days after, depending on schedules). We need your help to spread the JavaScript love to the entire world. We have seen the various drama in the rest of the development community and we know we can pull together something even better. Help us, help yourself, and help your friends to understand and eventually enjoy the language so many love to despise. We know there is a lot of things in the works for JSConf so please keep posted. We have posted the teaser trailer above to whet your appetite or remind you of some of the great events at JSConf 2009. If you want to see the full HD trailer, <a href="http://vimeo.com/4739942">we have posted it to Vimeo</a>. Help us out by tweeting, facebooking, "bliggity blogging" and doing whatever it is that you kids do these days the videos of JSConf 2009!
